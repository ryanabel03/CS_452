Parallelism / Concurrency
-------------------
  Parallelism: True hardware parallelism

  Concurrency: May run sequentially but will get the same results if run in parallel

Critical section problem
-------------------
  * n processes all competing to use some shared data
  * Each process has a code segment, called "critical section", in which shared data is accessed
  * Problem ensure that when one process is executing in critical section, no other process is allowed to execute it's critical section

  SOLUTION:
    Three components
      1. Mutual exclusion (No collisions)
        -- P0 and P1 are in the critical section simultaneously 

      2. Progress
        Not stuck:
          -- P1 is not interested in the critical section, and P0 is still blocked

        Not deadlocked
          -- P0 is blocked and P1 is blocked

      3. Bounded waiting (No starvation)
        -- P0 is blocked, P1 enters critical section repeatedly and indefinitely
