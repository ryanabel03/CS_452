Virtual memory
----------------------------------

  Pros:
    * Logical Adress space >> Physical address space
    * Increased efficiency
    * Increased multi-programming
    * Less I/O

  Cons:
    * Unpredictable runtimes

  Page fault:
    - Reference to page not yet in memory

  Demand paging:
    - Only bring page into memory when needed


  Went over page fault example
    -- Look up page in page table
    -- Find frame in physical memory
    -- If not resident yet, trap to OS
    -- Suspend process and get data from Disk
    -- Put page into physical memory
    -- Grab page from physical memory and map it to page table
    -- Resume instruction


  Utilizes:
    * Context switch
    * CPU burst - I/O burst
    * Semaphore
    * DMA / Interrupt
    * States (Running, blocked, ready)

  * Encourages overallocation

  * Page replacement
    -- Choose a victim
