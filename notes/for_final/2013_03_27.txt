Page replacement
---------------------------

  * Choose a victim
  
  * Find a page in memory, not in use

  Performance:
    * # of page faults
  
  Page reference string: "0 1 2 3 0 1 4 0 1 2 3 4"

  * Considering page references only, this is why we don't see hex values etc.
  * Compress consecutive page references: 0 0 0 0 -> 0
  * Demanding paging & local page replacement


  Strategies:
    First In First Out:
      * Replace "oldest" page
      * Use queue or logical time
      
      Pros:
        * Easy to implement

      Cons:
        - Inefficient
        - Beladys Anomaly
          * Reducing frames reduces the number of faults

    Optimal:
      * Replace the page that WONT be used for the longest time
      * Impossible

    Least Recently Used (LRU):
      * Replace the page that HASNT been used for the longest time
