# Thrashing
**Def'n:** *Overhigh paging activity*

* Process doesn't have enough Frames so we have more page faults

* When faults increase, CPU utilization drops

* When CPU Util drops, OS increases degree of multi-programming

* When multi-programming increases, we have fewer frames

**This action will keep looping**

*So why does paging work?*  

* Spatial locality

*So why does thrashing occur?*

* Sum of locality becomes greater than total memory (We overbooked the hotel, woops!)

# Working Set Theory
**IDEA:** Allocate enough frames to hold a processes "favored subset" of pages, it _won't_ fault

**Predicted Behavior:**
The fault rate would drop at a linear rate as pages are brought into memory

**Actual Behavior:**
There is a large dropoff of page faults after a certain percentage of pages are brought into memory. 


## Working set Algorithm
**delta** = working set window  
**WS(i)** = working set of Process P(i)  
**WSS(i)** = working set size of Process P(i)  
**D** = total memory demand (Sum of wss(i))

### Example
001011212223  56556   56533211211121

delta = 5  
WS(i) = {5, 6}  
WSS(i) = 2  
D = 2 + all other WSS(i) in system
	
	
### Problems
1. Determing size of delta
2. Determining a processes fault rate
3. Interlocality transition

### Solution: Page Fault Frequency Alg.
1. Use feedback from process to determine optimal (for system) frame allocation
2. Instead of determining fault rate (keeping history) We will keep track of time between faults – interfault time.
3. Use variable interval samplingå to determine if you are in a transitional period.
