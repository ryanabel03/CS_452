#Files
**File:** A named persistent collection of related information  
**Naming:** Unique, extension  
**Structure:** A stream of bytes   
**Types:** Regular, directory, special, I/O, pipes  
**Access:** Random/Sequential  

Files have operations, and a lot of attributes  
  
****

#Directories
Directories are just a file tuple: < filename inode# \>  

### Example

File /home/wolffe/cs452/lab10/temp.c  
  
The OS will parse through each directory (file) to make sure it exists before moving to the next directory


### Soft Links vs Hard Links

**Soft link:** Linking a file to another file, so when it changes in one place it changes in the other place as well. It is a pointer to a new inode, contents are pathname

**Hard link:** Similar to soft link, **BUT** it is a pointer to an EXISTING inode

****

# File system
User view of the files (make it pretty)  
Mappings  
**Superblocks:** Stores information about the file system (free blocks, sizes, etc.)

****

#File allocation

### Contiguous
Array-like  
**Mapping**   
Logical Addr / sizeof(block) = Q    
Logical Addr % sizeof(blck) = R  
Block = Start Addr + Q Displace R  
  
Example:
Block = 100 = 2 = Q  
Byte = 243 = 43 = R

At block number 2 in byte 3  
  
**Pros:**  
* Fast

**Cons:**  
* External fragmentation


### Linked-List like
**Mapping**  
Logical Addr / (sizeof(block) - sizeof(addr)) = Q  
Logical Addr % (sizeof(block) - sizeof(addr)) = R  
Block = Traverse Q links + Dipslace R  
  
**Pros:**
* Space efficient
  
**Cons:**  
* Really slow  
f* Small amount of internal fragmentation
