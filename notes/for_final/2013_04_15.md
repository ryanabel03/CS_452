#Disk Scheduling  
Goal is to reduce seek time because seek time is the only thing the filesystem can control  

###Seek Time  
Time to move R/W head to desired cylinder  

= StartupTime + numTracks *  headSpeed  
  
###Latency
Time for a sector to rotate until it is under the R/W head  
  
= 1 / (2 * Disk speed)  

###Transfer  
Data read  
= numBits / (DiskSpeed * (bits / track))  
  
##Algorithms  

###First Come First Served  
No reordering of request queue


### Shortest Seek Time First  
Sort to minimze next R/W head movement


### Scan / "Elevator" Algorithm  
Head sweeps disk and services requests in its path  


### Circular Scan  
Head sweeps unidirectionally
