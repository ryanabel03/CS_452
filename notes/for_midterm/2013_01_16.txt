Process scheduling
------------------

  Goal:
    * Efficiency
    * High utilization of CPU

  Parallelize processes P1 & P0
    CPU   | P0  P1   P0   P1
          |----|----|----|----|----|   ---- = 1 time unit
    I/O   |     P0   P1   P0   P1

  Context Switch:
    * see figure 3.4 in book
    * Moving processes on and off of CPU
