---------------------
CPU scheduling
---------------------
  * Goal is to increase performance (higher throughput)

  * Talking about short term scheduler (aka Dispatcher):

  Review Process characteristics
    -- Alternating CPU - I/O bursts

    -- CPU burst duration
      * see figure 5.2 in book
      * very very short

    -- Process / Burst Relationship


---------------------
Scheduling criteria
---------------------
  
  CPU utilization:
    * % of time CPU is busy executing user processes 
    * typically 40 - 80%

  Throughput:
    * Number of processes completed in a unit of time

  Turnaround time:
    * Time for a particular job to complete (use system avg)
    * = ProcessCompletionTime - ProcessArrivalTime
    * Normalized Time = TurnaroundTime / CPU Burst Time

  Waiting time:
    * Amount of time the process is in the ready queue (use system avg)

  Compute bound process:
    * The process is being bottled necked due to computation
    * Waiting time = Turanround time - CPU Burst Time


---------------------
Non Pre-emptive
---------------------
  * A process that can be interrupted

  First Come First Served (FCFS)
    * FIFO
    * Ordered

  Shortest Job First
    * Ready Queue
    * Orderd by Increasing CPU Burst Time

  Priority
    * Ready Queue
    * Order by priority
      -- Lower # == Higher Priority
